## 🎯 Integration with Your Original Template

The admin dashboard is designed to work alongside your existing gaming top-up template:

Both systems can work together - customers place orders through your original template, and admins manage them through this dashboard.

## 🚀 Next Steps

2. **Change Default Password**: Update admin credentials for security
3. **Customize**: Modify games, payment methods, or styling as needed
4. **Integration**: Connect with your existing order processing workflow

The system is fully functional and ready for production use. All source code is well-documented and the README file contains detailed setup and usage instructions.
